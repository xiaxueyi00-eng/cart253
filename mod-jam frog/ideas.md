# Starting points
This is an effortless, amusing, and timing game. The player controls the frog to eat the most flies before time runs out. 

The frog eats flies, but it gets harder and harder to catch them.

When the game starts, it will have a limited timer.

Eating the black fly can get 1 score.

Yellow flies are rare. When the frog eats the yellow fly, 3 seconds are added to the timer.

Adds anticipation and enhances game feel

The game goal is to eat 8 flies before the time reaches zero.

If the time runs out, the player loses and can restart.

The fly move up and down in a smooth wave-like motion.

Each fly has two cute white flapping wings.

For the game background, I added the sky, clouds, green water, and lily pads, creating a funny and calm pond environment.

When the frog eats the fly, it will have a voice.

At the end of the game, a frog will appear, spinning slowly and playfully ending.

At the end of the game, it will show the game’s highest score, increasing the player’s desire to win.
