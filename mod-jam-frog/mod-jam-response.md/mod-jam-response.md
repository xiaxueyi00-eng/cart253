I explored Yann’s interactive game “Frog Game,” which is a frog-catches-fly subject interaction game. Players use the mouse to move the frog, click, and launch the tongue to grab the fly. This game looks easy, but through the design of “time and rhythm, “it creates a continuous sense of tension. The scores gradually decrease over time, forcing the player to keep catching flies to maintain the rhythm. When the score reaches ten, it triggers a streak mode — the background turns orange, clouds and flies move faster, and both vibration and music shift in intensity, instantly putting the player in a state of high pressure and excitement. The most striking aspect for me is Yann’s precise control of rhythm and feedback: every time click, catch, and score follows a sound effect and animation, making operation feel brimming and rhythmic. Visually, the frog’s reflective glasses, the shimmering wings of the flies, and the layered movement of the clouds all demonstrate a strong attention to detail. This game's rhythm design and dynamic feedback are highly refined, creating an immersive experience reminiscent of classic arcade games.

Ya Xuan’s “Life as a Frog” is one of the most complete and most narratively rich works I experienced in the Mod Jam. She makes a catch-insect game mechanism with a time-lapse unit, creates a “day-night cycle” and “frog’s survival days,” and constructs a small ecology system. The work is most attractive because time gives impetus, and winged insects and the threat of light together create a sustained sense of tension, making the player feel like a real, free frog fragile in the environment. This holistic narrativity from environment to mechanics is the most compelling aspect of the work. Players need to hunt for food at daytime and avoid the flashlight at night; otherwise, the frog will gradually change color and finally die.  Most surprising to me, she uses color variables and millis()-based timing logic to create a believable rhythm of biological decline—the frog’s green gradually darkens and eventually fades into brown, symbolizing the slow passing of life. For vision, water surfaces fluctuate, could be moving, and birds and fluorescence appear, which is highly poetic, making the entire game feel like a small fable. The work from technique and emotion display to “survive” and “time” is delicately understood and touches the heartstrings of the player. From this game, I rethink “systemic design “importance. This work makes me understand interaction art and how to utilize easy rules to construct emotion, and it also makes me reflect over my own project and whether it could also develop in a more systematic and narrative direction.

Philippe’s “Frog Frog Frog” is a highly experimental interactive experience; it’s not only a game, but it also feels most like a fully realized interactive system. The player plays the part of a space frog and needs to eat as many flies as possible before the countdown ends to prolong oxygen time. For me, this work the most attract is last accumulate sense of urgency, space move, and speech sound warn, it’s not rely on a complex narrative to engage the player, the mechanics themselves attract people，make me want to try again and again.What impressed me most was how he built the entire project through a modular architecture—from the physics simulation in simulation.js to the NASA-inspired speech system in speech-synthesizer.js, which are all perfectly coordinated within the program. Vision, “Low Oxygen,” “Game Over,” etc., speech sounds warn and make learning through most contests. This work demonstrates a strong command of complex interactive system design and shows a thoughtful balance between code organization and user experience—truly impressive. This work makes me think my own work and helped me understand how an interactive work can balance complexity with playability.
