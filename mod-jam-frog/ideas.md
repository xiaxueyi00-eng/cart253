# Starting points
- This is an effortless, amusing, and timing game. The player controls the frog to eat the most flies before time runs out. 

- Added a gradually changing background to make the player's eyes relax.

- The frog eats flies, but it gets harder and harder to catch them.

- When the game starts, it will have a limited timer.

- Eating the black fly can get 1 score.

- Yellow flies are rare. When the frog eats the yellow fly, 3 seconds are added to the timer.

- Adds anticipation and enhances game feel

- The game goal is to eat 8 flies before the time reaches zero.

- If the time runs out, the player loses and can restart.

- The fly move up and down in a smooth wave-like motion.

- Each fly has two cute white flapping wings.

- For the game background, I added the sky, clouds, green water, and lily pads, creating a funny and calm pond environment.

- The fly will have a voice once the frog eats it.

- The game will conclude with a playful appearance of a frog.

- At the end of the game, it will show the game’s highest score, increasing the player’s desire to win.
