## Description

This project is a playful self-portrait made with p5.js.  
It combines new code with elements adapted from my previous assignment in class.  
The face is built from simple shapes (ellipse, arc, triangle, quad, rect).  

- The blush changes color gradually and shifts left and right over time (variables changing).  
- The eyes blink every few seconds using a conditional statement (`if`).  
- The pupils follow the mouse (`mouseX`), adding interactivity.  
- I experimented with the `arc()` function for the hair, which I hadnâ€™t used before.  
-For the eyes, I applied the logic we learned in class using `frameCount` and conditional statements. 
In my code, the eyes are normally open with a height of 80 pixels. 
Every 40 frames, the height of the eyes changes to 20 pixels for 10 frames, creating a blinking effect. 
This follows the same principle shown in class (using frame counts to control when something moves or changes), 
but instead of moving a character, I used it to simulate blinking eyes.
