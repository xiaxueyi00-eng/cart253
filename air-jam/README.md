## Description
This project uses p5.js to create a playful self-portrait.
 It blends experiments with newly learned functions with concepts covered in class.
 The face is constructed from simple geometric shapes (triangle, quad, ellipse, and arc), and it is adorned with a heart-shaped background..  

-	Blush
lerpColor() is used to gradually change the blush color over time.
-	Blinking eyes
A conditional (if) with frameCount makes the eyes blink every few seconds.
Inspired by the Week 3 group assignment.
-	Interactivity
The pupils follow the mouse (mouseX) to add interaction.
-	Hair
I used the arc() function for the hair, which was new to me.
-	Heart background
The heart is made of two circles and one triangle.
I used scale() with mouseWheel() for the first time to make it dynamically resize.
## Screenshot(s)

This bit should have some images of the program running so that the reader has a sense of what it looks like.

## Attribution

This bit should attribute any code, assets or other elements used taken from other sources. For example:

> - This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
> - The Week 3 group assignment served as the inspiration for the blinking eyes (using `frameCount` with conditionals) concept.  
> - Using `scale()` and `mouseWheel()`, dynamic resizing was added to the heart shape, which was inspired by basic geometric combinations (two circles and one triangle).
